# Ali Baba & the 40 Thieves — Game Overview

## What is this game?
Ali Baba & the 40 Thieves is a fast-paced, arena-style multiplayer browser game. Up to four heroes share the same cavern, racing to outplay one another with nimble movement and precision fireballs. Rounds are continuous: every defeat is followed by a quick respawn, so the action never stops.

## Player objective
Defeat as many rival heroes as you can. Each takedown adds to your kill count, while every time you drop to zero health tallies a death. The in-game HUD highlights kills, deaths, and online players so you always know where you stand.

## Core gameplay loop
1. **Join the caravan** – enter a hero name and spawn on a random platform inside the cavern.
2. **Rally and maneuver** – dash across platforms, string together triple jumps, and stay mobile to avoid incoming fire.
3. **Aim and unleash** – use the mouse cursor to line up shots and launch blazing fireballs at opponents. Precision wins fights.
4. **Score the knockout** – reduce enemy HP from 20 to 0 to claim a kill. Eliminated heroes instantly broadcast a defeat message.
5. **Respawn and repeat** – after a brief breather, fallen heroes respawn with full health, ready for the next skirmish.

## Move set & controls
- **Run** – `A` / `D` or `←` / `→`
- **Jump / Aerial mobility** – `Space`, `W`, or `↑`
  - You have **three consecutive jumps**: one on the ground plus two aerial recoveries.
  - A short “coyote time” lets you still jump right after stepping off a ledge.
- **Dash** – double-tap `A`/`←` to dash left, or `D`/`→` to dash right
  - Dashing grants a burst of horizontal speed, leaves a glowing trail, and has a short cooldown.
- **Fireball** – left mouse click (or hold) / press `M`
  - Fireballs travel toward the cursor, inherit your facing direction, and briefly cool down before you can cast again.
- **Aim** – move the mouse; the reticle snaps to world space so you can lead targets.

## Combat details
- Heroes start with **20 HP**. Fireballs deal 1 HP of damage on hit.
- Taking damage flashes the target red and grants temporary invulnerability, preventing instant follow-up hits.
- Falling off-screen is impossible—the cavern walls keep everyone in play.
- Defeating or self-KO’ing a player triggers a toast message visible to everyone.

## Audio & feedback
- Background score kicks in once a player interacts with the page.
- Fireballs and knockouts use distinct sound effects, providing quick feedback.
- Dash trails, hit flashes, and nameplates help identify movement, damage taken, and hero identity mid-match.

## Multiplayer rules
- Supports **up to four concurrent players**.
- Player names must be unique (case-insensitive) and up to 20 characters.
- Inactive heroes are automatically removed after 30 seconds so new players can join.
- If the room is full, incoming players are politely turned away with a message.

## Heads-up display
- **Name bar** – shows your chosen hero name.
- **Health bar** – visual and numerical gold bar that retracts as you take damage.
- **Status ticker** – reports players online, current HP, and your kill/death tally.
- **System messages** – centered callouts for respawns, defeats, and lobby notifications.

## Quick facts
- Matches run continuously—no hard round timer.
- Moments after defeat, you respawn at one of several spawn points with full health.
- Movement-heavy players gain an edge: chaining jumps, timing dashes, and leading shots are key skills.

Jump in, stay nimble, and prove you’re the sharpest hero in the cavern.
